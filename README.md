# DetectPhones
This is a simple Phone Detection Web Application built using FastAPI (Backend) and HTML + JavaScript (Frontend). It scans the local network and detects active devices (such as phones) connected to the Wi-Fi network.  The backend provides a REST API endpoint to return detected devices, and the frontend displays the result with a button click.
